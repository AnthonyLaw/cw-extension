# Development Guidelines

The project is in a alpha stage, we accept any kind of contributions. Up to today, the guidelines are:

- Open an issue with the feature you would like to implement to notify others you are working on that feature.
- Open a Pull Request with:
  - Short description of the feature
  - If it can contain some unit tests, better.
- The Pull Request will be merged as soon as possible.

We will be adding more guidelines as long as we receive more contributors.
